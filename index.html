                    based out of Charlotte, North Carolina. When I’m not working or programming you can usually find me outside on a hike, playing nerdy board games with my friends, or working on my conga skills. <br> <br></span>
                    <span class='p2'>I recently graduated from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Before that, I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a degree in computer science and a minor in religious studies. <br> <br></span>
                    <span class='p3'>I am currently working on a few things in my free time. One of those things is my mathematics blog, where I revisit topics from my undergraduate courses with a new lens. I’m also working on reading through the entire Bible…commentary coming soon.
